 # Guitar-Fuzz-Pedal
Hi in this project we will make our own effect pedal for both bass and electric guitar. If you know basic circuitry you can play around with the components and modify your pedal.


### **SIDE NOTE !** 
Before moving forward I would like to inform you the problems you might ran into. If you are planning to build this circuit on a breadboard it could caught some hums and noise from the jumper cables, power supply, other components and such. My advice is to built the pedal on a perfboard after testing on a breadboard, and keep the cables short as possible, because we are dealing with auido signals they are very sensitive to noise.
